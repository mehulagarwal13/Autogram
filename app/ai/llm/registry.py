"""
Task routing table — the single place where "which model handles which task" lives.

Changing a model, temperature, or provider for any task is a one-line edit here.
No application code references model names or vendor SDKs.

Routing philosophy (cost-aware):
- Cheap/structured extraction tasks -> small, fast models.
- Reasoning/generation tasks (tailoring, cover letters, career advice) -> premium models.
- Non-LLM work (embeddings, skill taxonomy matching) never enters this table —
  it stays on local open-source models (sentence-transformers) or plain Python.
